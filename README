This README describes the changes I made to the Minix 2.0.0 kernel so that it can run on my modified PC/XT motherboard BIOS; see https://sites.google.com/site/eyalabraham/pc-xt and https://github.com/eyalabraham/new-xt-bios.
As a reference, I used the porting notes compiled by Bill Buzbee on his web site http://www.homebrewcpu.com/minix_port.htm for his home brew CPU MAGIC-1.

This is really not a true 'port' of Minix, but rather an adaptation of Minix to my custom BIOS. The custom BIOS was required in this XT motherboard because of the missing HW and the HW I built to replace what was missing:
- a 40GB IDE hard drive driven by a 8255. The hard drive hosts 2 x 1.44MB floppies and one 2GB fixed disk.
- custom serial UART that replaces both the display adapter and keyboard; interface through minicom that is a VT100 emulator on Linux

The motherboard does not have any serial nor parallel interfaces, and has 640KB of RAM and is fully functional to boot and run DOS 6.22.

Activity and changes I made to the Minix kernel code and my BIOS in chronological order:

================================
=   Minix change for newbios   =
================================

config.h changes
--------------------------------
1. console count to 1, rs232 to 0 and pty to 0
2. HDD handling only through BIOS
3. added 1 x PTY

todo
1. <nothing>

Console driver
--------------------------------

tty, console (screen), keyboard, pty and serial device initialization process

 start scheduler   -> tty_task() -> tty_init() -> scr_init() -or- rs_init() -or- pty_init()
                                                     |
                                                     +-->  kb_init() 
                                                       only from scr_init()

   mpx88.s              tty.c         tty.c         console.c        rs232.c         pty.c
\................/    \......../    \........./  \............./  \........../  \............./
                                                    keyboard.c
                                                 \............./
                                                   one of the above will be called
                                                   depending on NR_CONS and NR_RS_LINES
                                                   with NR_CONS=1 and NR_RS_LINES=0 only
                                                   the screen and keyboard will be initialized
Modifications done in steps as follows:

console.c
1. flush() updated to send characters through INT10h
2. out_char() updated to handle character codes for vt100 emulator
3. bypass all CRT chip HW code

klib88.s
1. added int10
2. added registers

proto.h
1. added int10 prototype

todo
1. need to take another look at 'tab' and other special key handling
2. check escape code and color print on vt100 console emulator

Keyboard driver
--------------------------------

keyboard.c
1. keyboard handling depends on interrupts. when a keyboard interrupt occurs,
   the keyboard handler captures the key stroke *and* signals tty for processing
   using int16 is not possible because a polling mechanism cannot be integrated.
   so decisions for handling are done in run-time based on global flag 'isNewXT'
   a. hooking new XT interrupt vector vs. PC vector
   b. reading PC keyboard HW vs. reading UART
   c. handling PC scan-code vs. ASCII in new XT
2. allowing function wreboot() to run to enable 'reboot' and 'halt' processing

const.h
1. added interrupt vector number for new XT hardware with UART

todo
1. <nothing>

Floppy drive driver
--------------------------------

kernel/floppy.c      kernel/driver.c                              kernel/floppy.c

floppy_task()    ->  driver_task()    ->  ... do_rdwt()  ->  (1) f_prepare(), (2) f_schedule(), (3) f_finish() -> f_transfer()

                    \................................./      \.............................................................../
                     loop and wait for driver commands             called by do_rdwt()
                      open/close/read/write/ioctl etc.
                      
                            \................................................................................................/
                                                                 driver loop
floppy.c
1. Commented all floppy controller HW port commands
2. replaced DMA+Controller IO process with INT13 based call in f_transfer()
3. Removed seek and calibration process, now returning fake good status

todo
1. <nothing>

/******* created test image, git tag: "minix-boot-v1c.img" *******/

System setup
--------------------------------
1. copy directories from ROOT.img to the new boot image.
   for directory /usr, no need to copy contents
2. bring up in a VM and run MAKEDEV for the devices we need inside the /dev directory
3. load above image to XT into fd0 (alt.0 location)
4. load basic /usr from USR.img to XT into fd1
5. after monitor starts, his ESC and change 'rootdev' to fd0 and save
4. unset 'processor' 'bus' and 'emssize', then save again
5. continue boot and when asked for /usr mount enter fd1
6. system will boot and need to enter user 'root'
7. hard drive partitioning ...
           /dev/hd0    Whole hard disk #0
              /dev/hd1    Keep a 50MB DOS partition (type 06h)
              /dev/hd2    MINIX /usr partition (50MB)
              /dev/hd3    MINIX /home partition  (50MB)
8. follow "5. MANUAL INSTALLATION" section in minix-annotated-vm-installation
   - change rootdev to /fd1 for these next steps, then change back to /fd0
   - load usr.taz into /usr, sys.taz into /usr file parts in /home
   - optional cmd.taz file parts in /home
   - use 'vol', better to use 'dd'
   - unpack: 'cat xxx.taz | uncompress | tar xvfp - ' into proper dir
     usr.taz and sys.taz go into /usr
   - fix /etc/fstab to include root and usr definitions, and reset boot monitor 'rootdev' to /fd0
   - update /etc/rc startup shell to mount /dev/hd3 as /home
   - modify: /etc/issue, /etc/rc, /etc/fstab
   - echo "minix-xt" >/etc/hostname.file

Disable printer driver
--------------------------------

1. Changes in printer_task();

PUBLIC void printer_task()
{
/* Main routine of the printer task. */

  message pr_mess;		/* buffer for all incoming messages */
  
#if NEWXT_BIOS
  /* commenting out the initialization */
#else
  print_init();		/* initialize */
#endif

  while (TRUE) {
	receive(ANY, &pr_mess);
	reply(TASK_REPLY, pr_mess.m_source, pr_mess.PROC_NR, EINVAL);
#if NEWXT_BOOS
  /* all requests will be ignored */
#else
	switch(pr_mess.m_type) {
	    case DEV_OPEN:
	    case DEV_CLOSE:
		reply(TASK_REPLY, pr_mess.m_source, pr_mess.PROC_NR, OK);
		break;
	    case DEV_WRITE:	do_write(&pr_mess);	break;
	    case CANCEL   :	do_cancel(&pr_mess);	break;
	    case HARD_INT :	do_done();		break;
	    default:
		reply(TASK_REPLY, pr_mess.m_source, pr_mess.PROC_NR, EINVAL);
	}
#endif
  }
}

1. <nothing>

Remove protected mode code
--------------------------------

  ? : may need to change
  + : code chages
 nc : no need for code change

Protected mode code locations:
  ? boothead.s
  + bios_wini.c      remove enable_vectors() and associated call
 nc console.c        no need to change, already removed with NEWBIOS_MINIX definition
 nc dp8390.c         no need to change, already removed with ENABLE_NETWORKING definition
  ? glo.h            may need to remove external variables: 'protected_mode' and 'struct segdesc_s gdt[]'
  + i8259.c          removed in put_irq_handler() and intr_init()
 nc keyboard.c       no need to change, already removed with NEWBIOS_MINIX definition
  ? klib88.c         to complicated to remove
 nc memory.c         very little code, no need to bother
 nc misc.c           very little code, no need to bother
  ? mpx88.s          to complicated to remove
  ? protect.c / .h   initialization code for protected mode, to complicated to remove
  ? proto.h          to complicated to remove
  + start.c          skipped call to prot_init(), but let setting of 'protected_mode' variable
  + system.c         conditional compiled some code
 nc tty.c            very little code, no need to bother
 nc type.h           letf type definitions intact

1. updated files above
2. left variable 'protected_mode' defined because not all code was removed
3. results of last builds (not really worth the time):

================================
=  Minix initialization order  =
================================

- 'bootimage.c' is called by the boot loader
- 'bootimage.c' loads the image from disk
- 'bootimage.c' function exec_image() parses the image for kernel, mm, fs, init components
  and patches memory sizes into kernel data segment (see 'mpx88.s' _sizes array)
- 'bootimage.c' starts minix with a call to minix() located in 'mpx88.s'
- 'mpx88.s' is the minix entry point. it initializes parameters and jumps to main() in 'main.c'
- 'main.c' does
  1. clearing process table
  2. parsing 'tasktab[]' that is located in 'table.c' to build the process table:
  p_reg.pc gets initial pc program counter
- scheduler is started and executes tasks in order from process table using a fake 'iret'

boot loader --> bootimage.c --> mpx88.s/MINIX() --> main.c --> mpx88.s/_restart()

January 5, 2014

Tested the diskette image 'changer' BIOS code and completed debugging; it is now functional and provides 4 on-the-fly changeable floppy-0 images.
Because I did not yet adapt the Minix kernel to my BIOS, I can only attempt to load the Minix monitor program. This program behaves like a boot loader and loads from the first floppy MBR; I loaded the image and tried booting.
Minix monitor booted! I got a bunch of unhandled INT10 function (INT10/12 and INT10/1A) warnings from my BIOS so I'm going to fix these and try again until I get a clean monitor bring-up.



January 1. 2014

From the installation test I did on a VM, I realized I needed the ability to swap floppy images - like swapping diskettes - in order to complete the installation of the Minix /usr directory; this directory holds the source code and UNIX tools.
My custom BIOS only emulated two floppy drives in the form of images on the host hard drive. There was no possibility to live-swap images like one would swap diskettes. I decided to 'steal' the floppy count dip switches (SW.8 and SW.7) and use them as selectors of one of four floppy images stored on the host hard drive. This way, when prompted to change a diskette and hit Enter, I simply change the dip switches and a different emulated floppy image is mapped to the BIOS.
The BIOS already has a monitor mode with functions that allow uploading images into the host hard drive and moving them around.



December 29, 2013

The first step was to complete an installation of Minix 2 so that I can figure out the 'logistics' of the installation. My XT does not have physical floppies, has emulated floppies in the form of images that re stored on the host hard drive.
In order to install Minix, I needed to know how many images I need and then create this floppy images and load them into my host hard drive.
To achieve this step, I chose to use a virtual machine running on VMware Player. This VM can use physical floppies - which my much newer machine does not even have - or present floppy image files.
So I set out to create floppy images of the installation set for Minix 2 and installed on a VM <screen-shot>.



An unorganized list of next steps

Minix areas I inspected and think I need to change (initial list only):
0.  Find a way to cross compile the kernel on my Linux machine and just drop it into a floppy image that I can then transfer and boot my XT with
1.  Minix directly manipulates the video RAN, and does not seem to use BIOS int10
    need to replace all direct video controller manipulation with INT10 or direct UART calls
2.  Same as above, but as applied for keyboard handling
3.  HDD driver in Minix kernel can use BIOS 13 calls or manipulate the controller directly
    There seems to be a way to instruct the kernel to do ether one - so need to test this.
4.  Keyboard and display, UART and hard drive interrupts are slightly different in my XT compared to a standard machine
    need to find where the 8259 and interrupt vectoring 'lives' in Minix and adapt them
5.  Check Bill Buzbee's list below and filter what relevant
6.  remove support for HW that does not exist in my system and will likely not be there ever.
    I think that this will save memory with a smaller kernel and reduce a bit of complexity

List of areas mantioned by Bill Buzbee for his MAGIC-1, and his comments:
-- note: stopped reading at date 6/3/07 of Bill's blog
1.  Config.h - Add MAGIC1 machine and HOMEBREWCPU chip type.  For now, select 1 console, 1 rs232 line a 4 virtual terminals.
2.  Const.h - Set click size 2048 and click shift to 11
3.  jmp_buf.h, sys/sigcontext.h - Decide on sigcontext structure for Magic1
4.  type.h - set lengths
5.  a.out.h - replace with my new a.out.h
6.  alloca.h - replace with the alloca code and .h that I'm currently using with lcc
7.  setjmp.h - I need to implement this, and replace
8.  stdarg.h - replace with my lcc/Magic-1 stdarg.h
9.  stddef.h - Double-check it's identical what what I'm currently using
10. time.h - Set to Magic-1's 64 hz. tick
11. net/hton.h - Set to correct endianness
12. at_wini.c - Use this as a basis.  Either heavily modify or rewrite.  Take a look at the bios_wini.c.  Might want to start with that as it busy-waits disk IO.
13. clock.c - Add Magic-1 specific RTC control code
14. const.h - lots of machine specific stuff.  Start with minimum set: K_STACK_BYTES, NR_MEMS, SETPSW
15. dmp.c - Debugging stuff - make is useful for me.
16. memory.c - Machine dependent stuff
17. proc.c - Machine specific stuff; make sure message copying is fast (may need to go to assembly)
18. proto.h - A bit of work here - need to declare machine specific functions
19. rs232.c - A bit of worn here, but not that much.  Mostly generalize to support 16550 at a memory-mapped location in addition to x86's port-addressed scheme.
20. system.c - Lots of work here, I think.
21. table.c - Eliminate unnecessary tasks.
22. tty.c - Lots of work
23. type.h - Stack frame defines
24. xt_wini.c - don't need this

Useful things to remember
-   compile Minix kernel on Minix machine: http://risenfall.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/howto-compile-minix-kernel/
-   making a bootable floppy (see http://minix1.woodhull.com/manpages/man8/installboot.8.html)
        1. make kernel, fs, mm, init and boot
           running the 'make' in /usr/src/init runs all of the above and step 2 below
        2. in the /usr/src/init directory run
           'installboot -i image ./kernel/kernel ../mm/mm ../fs/fs init
        3. copy 'boot' and image to floppy
        4. in /usr/src/boot run 'installboot /dev/<fd?> ./bootblock boot'
        5. set root directory: if the above was run AFTER the install then set the 'rootdev=hd1a' in monitor
